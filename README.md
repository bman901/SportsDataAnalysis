The intention is to create a tool which can analyse historic data (wins vs odds) from various sports to find the most efficient sport i.e. the sport in which the favourite wins most often.

Given that we're working with historic data which doesn't change, I first want to download the data request from the API so I don't need to continue calling it; this is just to save paying the ongoing fee.
